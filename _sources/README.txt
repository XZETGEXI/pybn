Purpose
=======

PyBN (Python Bayesian Networks) is a python module for creating simple
Bayesian networks. Its flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a
large suite of problems. Along with the core functionality, PyBN includes an
export to `GeNIe`_.


Getting started
===============

This guide provides all the information needed to install PyBN, code a
Bayesian network, run the sampler, save and visualize the results. In
addition, it contains an export to `GeNIe`_.
